## Overview

This was a basic challenge that I did for fun after signing up for frontend.io.

### Links

## My process

This was a rather simple task. I simply started from the mobile layout, wrote
the basic html structure, set up my css variables, and then used flexbox to
achieve the desired result.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was all review for me. However, with tools like tailwind and react, I
almost never write vanilla HTML/CSS anymore. This exercise was a good refresher
on how to make sites the old fashioned way.

### Continued development

I think I will continue to use frontend.io to complete more difficult challenges
that will demonstrate my skills
